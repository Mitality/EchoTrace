EchoTrace is a plugin for the kind of situation where you lost sight of a friend and don't know where to go. Instead of checking your coordinates and doing math, it allows you to spawn in visual and accustic indicators that gently point you in the right direction.

The whole plugin is highly customizable, allowing you to tweak it to your liking and by default, only the command executor can see and hear traces.
